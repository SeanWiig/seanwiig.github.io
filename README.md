Threejs rendering of recursively inscribed platonic solids

Cubes and octahedrons are two of the five platonic solids. The faces of a cube correspond to the corners of an octahedron, and vice versa. In this rendering, cubes and octahedrons are inscribed inside one another recursively, such that the corners of the inside polyhedron touch the centers of the faces of the containing polyhedron.
